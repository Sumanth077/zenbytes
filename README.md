ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework to create production-ready machine learning pipelines. Built for data scientists, it has a simple, flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered towards ML workflows.

Check out the [ZenML repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) and [Docs](https://docs.zenml.io) for more details.
